main.py contains the main file you need to run, all options are included 
within, you just need to run it in the shell or vs code or something.  
All other files are sorted via either being for the electron-electron 
interaction [el_el] or electron-phonon interaction [el_ph]. each are then 
labelled with what they do. 

generator - generates all diagrams 
disconnected - contained the function which removed all disconnected 
topological equiv - reduces all diagrams down to their top inequiv forms 
genFunctions - contains functions used throughout multiple files 

there are no key variables, but the key functions are: 
 
all_diagrams(n) - gens all diagrams for the given n 
connected_check(i,n) - checks id the diagram i is connected for the given n 
all_swapps(n) - finds all possible transformations of variables for top equiv proof 

all el_ph lines of code are roughly notated but not all el_el are,  
they work the same way but have different limits. 
 
Any issues let me know. 

NOTE: have not included the self-energy code as it is very slow, buggy and  
sometimes didn't work. (very complicated bit of code). can still give it to 
you though if requested.
